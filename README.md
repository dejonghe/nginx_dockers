# NGINX Dockers
NGINX Docker Containers

## What this is
This is a colection of NGINX Docker containers that I maintain and have built throughout my involvement in the NGINX community. 

## Whats the purpose
* To share quick starts with others
* To keep reminders of how I've done things

## Where they come from
* Testing and validating code while writing [The NGINX Cookbook]()
* My attendance at NGINX Conf 2017
